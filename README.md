# Forearm prosthEsis foR tRaining And self-expeRIence (FERRARI)

## Team Project - Third Term  
**University:** Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)

**Mentors:**  
- Prof. Johannes Martinek (Technikum Wien)  
- Prof. Iris Nemec (Technikum Wien)
- Vladyslav Khmelevskoi (Renesas, Senior Embedded Engineer)

**Students:**
- Bugir Elizabeth
- Hombosh Oleh
- Sova Yulia
- Yakovenko Olena

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a **wearable prosthetic hand** that can be controlled through **surface EMG (electromyographic) signals**.

It allows people **without limb amputation** to simulate real prosthesis control and explore myoelectric technology in an educational, low-cost way.

The system combines:
- EMG sensors for muscle signal acquisition
- STM32-based microcontroller for signal processing
- Servo motors for actuation of the 3D-printed hand


## Goals
- Create a **functional prototype** mounted over a healthy hand
- Implement **EMG-based gesture control** (e.g., open/close hand)
- Provide **real-time feedback**



## Hardware Components
*(To be updated after hardware setup)*   



## Software Structure
*(To be completed during development)*
